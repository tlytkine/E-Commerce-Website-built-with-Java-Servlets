<h3>Textbooks for College Students by College Students</h2>

<p>
Welcome to <i>TFCSBCS</i> (Textbooks for College Students by College 
Students.<br>
<ul>
<li> This is a website designed for students to be able
to buy textbooks within their university.
</li>
<li>
The idea behind this is that by limiting access to only members 
of a specific university, students will be able to get the 
textbooks they need for their classes without leaving
campus.
</li>
<li>
Textbooks can be obtained for a fair price
without having to deal with potential scammers and meaningful interactions could be facilitated between students who took
the same courses.
</li>
</ul>
